            <br>
            I am very grateful for taking this course near the end of my studies for my BSIT degree. From the start of this course, I had a pretty<br> good understanding of how the web worked. 
            Taking this Web Systems course gave me a practical approach to how web applications work.<br> I learned how to host my own website and publish content onto the internet. I learned 
            about several important functions that are used in every <br>website, including:
            <ul>
                <li>Form input and form validation</li>
                <li>JSON</li>
                <li>Animation</li>
                <li>Drag & drop</li>
                <li>Content management</li>
                <li>Gaming</li>
            </ul><br>
            I believe the best learning comes from hands-on experience. Many of the classes I’ve taken use a more lecture/book focused approach with little hands-on work. When it <br>comes to creating web applications, 
            I can research many of the different approaches to build a website or perform a specific function. However, none of that research matters <br>if it is not put to practical use. Making this web application 
            with pages of projects that I built myself (through countless hours of trial and error) will help me much more than any<br> other studying I’ve done thus far.<br><br>
	        From searching the web for software engineering jobs, I realize that I still need more experience in other aspects of web design. Being a full stack engineer seems to be the most<br> desired applicant, 
            which means I will need experience with back-end development, as well as more front-end experience. It could also help to have more experience with other <br>programming languages (like PHP or SQL) as it seems 
            those are desired traits for a job in web development.
